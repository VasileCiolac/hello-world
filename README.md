First repostory

My name is Baba Dorin. I'm studying at Iulia Hasdeu college, in Republic of Moldova. I like to code. Unfortunately, I'm a newbie in this domain. All I know to do at the moments is just some simple C# Console Aplications, but my predending for more knowledge brought me here, on GitHub.
